I like being creative and experiment, everywhere and especially in software development, which is what I do for a living.

At times I also speak, publish, contribute to open source, invent things and share what I learned with others.

Currently I'm based in Austria, where I work as the technical lead of a software development team for a well known European digital entertainment company, specialized in online gaming and gambling.
